Needlestack is a distributed vector search microservice.


- Free software: Apache License 2.0
- Documentation: https://needlestack.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

- gRPC server for kNN vector search
- Shard vectors over multiple nodes
- Replicate shard over multiple nodes
- Retrieve vectors by ID


Limitations
-----------
The current alpha builds have limitations that make them difficult to use in production.
These should be addressed in future builds.

Caveats
~~~~~~~

- Vectors must be manually sharded, indexed, and serialized to disk as protobufs
- When shard protobuf files update, ``SearcherServicers`` in the cluster must be restarted
- Only kNN library currently supported is `Faiss <https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/>`_

Solutions
~~~~~~~~~

- Provide module to automatically shard and serialize a collection of vectors
- Provide gRPC endpoint to index vectors in real-time
- Allow vectors to be loaded from various data sources (S3, GCS, etc)
- Update vectors without restarting the cluster
- Add support for other kNN libraries
